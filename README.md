## Pastworks

## Medical term uses of Virtual Reality for colour blindness diagnosis (2019)
Using Unity game engine I decide to make a Virtual Colour blindness test. So I can prove the accuracy of the test while it is easy to use and somewhat entertaining. You can read the papers here

This project qualified for regional NSC and 2 Gold medals 2 Years back-to-back at STEM Program presentation. although grew up knowing that this software is such a mess and doesn't serve a lot of purposes, it is still something, a 17~18-Year-old doing a project about Medical and Virtual Reality alone is awesome enough.

## SpellBreaker - Boardgame 

Not a Fail project but just an unfinished one, I might turn this into a Computer game someday, if I ever perfect it though XD.
